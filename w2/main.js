// How to calculate your carbon footprint
// Method 1

// 1. Count the members of your household
const myHouseMembers = 12;
// 2. Consider the size of your home
const myHomeSize = 7;
// 3. Evaluate your food choices
const myFoodChoices = 14;
// 4. Examine your water consumption
const waterConsumption = 2;
// 5. Determine how many household purchases you make each year
const myPurchases = 8;
// 6. Consider how much waste you produce
const wasteAlot = 30;
// 7. Identify the amount of waste you recycle
const ReduceReuseRecycle = 24;
// 8. Tally up your annual transportation scores
const driveBy = 16;
// 9. Add up your score 
const cfpTotal = myHouseMembers + myHomeSize + myFoodChoices + waterConsumption + myPurchases + wasteAlot + ReduceReuseRecycle + driveBy 
// Write JS to update html (index.html) with total footprint
